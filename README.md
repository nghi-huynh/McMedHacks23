# McMedHacks_23

Assignments for McMedHacks 2023 program

Week 2: Image Processing + Deep Learning Fundamentals

* RSNA DICOM images: only select a few examples for preprocessing technique demo 50 patient ids from https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/rsna-breast-cancer-detection/data
* Preprocessing notebook: Read and load DICOM images + Preprocess + Resize
* Training notebook: Simple baseline using Pytorch including cross-validation, loss function, evaluation function and data augmentation
* Inference notebook: Infer on simple test set


Week 8: Model generalization

* More RSNA DICOM images: 25 positive patient_ids, 50 negative patient_ids
* EDA: check if dataset is balanced or not
* Task 1: Determine which evaluation metrics to use
* Task 2: Upsampling vs Downsampling and their caveats
